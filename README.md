Install Python 3.x
Launch Command Prompt as administrator
Type: python program_name.py

If you want to make it an executable .exe file, here are the instructions:

Install PyInstaller: pip install pyinstaller
Navigate to your script directory
Run: pyinstaller --onefile program_name.py
Find the executable in the 'dist' folder

Now you have the program working forever.
